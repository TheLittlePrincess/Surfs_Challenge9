# Surfs_Challenge9
Challenge for Module 9
## Overview
The objective of this project is to determine the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round before opening the shop. 
## Results
After looking at historical data for the temperatures for June and December, as seen in the side-by-side comparison statistics below (fig 1), we can say that:

-	Minimum temperatures in December are 12.5% lower than those in June (56 vs 64), 
-	Average (mean) temperature is above 70 degrees in both months with less than 4 degrees difference
-	Max temperature is not that different, merely 2 degrees higher Jun vs Dec

## Conclusions
-	Although the minimum temperatures in December are a good 12.5% lower than those in June (56 vs 64), the average temperature is above 70 degrees in both months with less than 4 degrees difference, and the highs merely 2, suggesting being warm enough for the surf and ice cream business.

-	More samples for the month of June, suggest more precipitations, which I ran out of curiosity â€“ see fig.2 below, for the side-by-side comparison statistics for the two months. It shows that although there are more occurrences tracked for June, the actual volume of rain is higher in December, suggesting that there are just not being tracked or the intensity is higher.

-	Highly recommend looking deeper into the rain and comparing the weather for additional months to define weather in fact keeping the shop open all year long is feasible.

-	Looking into wind and/or tides historical records would be highly instructive for the surfing side of the business
